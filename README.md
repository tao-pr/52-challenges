# 52 Challenges

A collection of quick weekly programming challenges for fun. 
Each challenge should not take longer than 7 days to solve. 

## Purpose

Coding for fun every week consecutively for a year (52 weeks). 
The difficulty of the challenge should progress gradually to keep 
the people exciting and motivated to try new techniques, tools, ideas, etc. 
as solutions to the new challenges.
